## Note on Migration

The migration script:
- Creates new tables for categories and tags
- Preserves existing data by migrating current category strings to the new table
- Adds foreign key relationships
- Sets up indexes for performance
- Enables Row Level Security (RLS)

After running the migration, existing competitors will automatically be linked to their categories.
